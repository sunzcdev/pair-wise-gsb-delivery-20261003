Simple, useful and opinionated config loader.

## Rationale

There are many solutions regarding configuration loading in Go. I was looking for a simple loader that is as easy to use and understand as possible. The goal was to load config from 4 places: defaults (in the code), files, environment variables, command-line flags. This library works with all of these sources.

## Features

* Simple API.
* Clean and tested code.
* Automatic fields mapping.
* Supports different sources:
  * defaults in the code
  * files (JSON, YAML, TOML, DotENV, HCL)
  * environment variables
  * command-line flags
* Dependency-free (file parsers are optional).
* Ability to walk over configuration fields.

## Install

Go version 1.14+

```
go get github.com/cristalhq/aconfig
```

## Example

```go
type MyConfig struct {
	Port int `default:"1111" usage:"just give a number"`
	Auth struct {
		User string `required:"true"`
		Pass string `required:"true"`
	}
	Pass string `default:"" env:"SECRET" flag:"sec_ret"`
}

var cfg MyConfig
loader := aconfig.LoaderFor(&cfg, aconfig.Config{
	// feel free to skip some steps :)
	// SkipDefaults: true,
	// SkipFiles:    true,
	// SkipEnv:      true,
	// SkipFlags:    true,
	EnvPrefix:       "APP",
	FlagPrefix:      "app",
	Files:           []string{"/var/opt/myapp/config.json", "ouch.yaml"},
	FileDecoders: map[string]aconfig.FileDecoder{
		// from `aconfigyaml` submodule
		// see submodules in repo for more formats
		".yaml": aconfigyaml.New(),
	},
})

// IMPORTANT: define your own flags with `flagSet`
flagSet := loader.Flags()

if err := loader.Load(); err != nil {
	panic(err)
}

// configuration fields will be loaded from (in order):
//
// 1. defaults set in structure tags (see MyConfig defenition)
// 2. loaded from files `file.json` if not `ouch.yaml` will be used
// 3. from corresponding environment variables with the prefix `APP_`
// 4. command-line flags with the prefix `app.` if they are
```

## Merging slices of objects by identity

Files are applied as layers (see `MergeFiles`). A regular slice is replaced by
every later layer, which makes it impossible to override just one element.

A slice of structs whose element type declares an **identity field** is merged
instead. Mark one field of the element struct with `identity:"true"`:

```go
type Pool struct {
    Name    string `json:"name" identity:"true"`
    MaxConn int    `json:"max_conn"`
}

type Config struct {
    Pools []Pool `json:"pools"`
}
```

Then a later layer is merged element by element using the identity value:

* elements not mentioned by the later layer are kept,
* elements with the same identity are updated field by field (nested fields included),
* elements with a new identity are appended after the existing ones, in layer and input order,
* `{"name": "old", "$delete": true}` removes the matching element.

A layer that provides an empty array changes nothing, so it is different from
deleting every element explicitly. Duplicated or missing identities inside a
single layer are an error, and an update can never rename an existing element:
an identity value that does not match anything is appended rather than applied.
Regular (non-identified) slices keep the whole-slice replacement behaviour.
